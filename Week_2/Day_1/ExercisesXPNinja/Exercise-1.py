# Exercise 1 : Use the terminal
# Instructions

#     Run this command in the terminal to open a python console:

# $ python3

# Hint: Replace python3 with python for Windows

#     Read about the PATH variable. Try to explain why you can call python3 if you arenâ€™t in the executable directory.
#     PATH explanation can be found here.



#The path variable sets the "python3" as and alias to the full path, for exemple ~/username/python3.exe
