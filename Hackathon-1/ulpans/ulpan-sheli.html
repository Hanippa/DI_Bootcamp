                Ulpan Sheli is the Hebrew course for new immigrants to Israel who want to immerse themselves in Israeli culture. <br> 
                    Learning is both very practical and fun, all in very small classes. Our team has decided to put its knowledge at the service of new 
                    immigrants from all over the world and to accompany them as best as possible in their new life. <br>
                     Our goal is to provide you with the richest learning experience.
                    The teaching method will allow you to work on your writing as well as you are speaking and for those who are in Israel, to be able to integrate better into Israeli society.
