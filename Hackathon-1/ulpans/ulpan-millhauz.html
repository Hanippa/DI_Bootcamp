                Ulpan Milhauz is situated in the very heart of Ramat Gan, in the Bursa and in Petah Tikva. We pride ourselves on our great locations, expert teachers, fast learning pace and fantastic students. Our Ulpan is lively and multicultural, it speaks many languages and has a deep connection to the real lives of our students and their needs.
 
Our students start speaking Hebrew from their very first class!
 
Our students are divided into different groups according to their levels of Hebrew. We are using the Hebrew University of Jerusalem program for our groups in various formats: small groups with a voucher (from 4 to 8 people), private courses (6-8 people), and an intensive course with up to 12 people in a group.
