-- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Items and customers
-- Instructions

-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

--     Use SQL to get the following from the database:
--         All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
--         Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
--         The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ exclude the primary key column from the results.
--         All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)

SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY price;
SELECT * FROM items WHERE price >= money(80) ORDER BY price DESC;
SELECT item_name, price FROM items ORDER BY item_name LIMIT 3;
SELECT surname from customers ORDER BY surname
