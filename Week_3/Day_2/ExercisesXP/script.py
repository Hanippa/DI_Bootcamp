# 🌟 Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions

# Using this code:

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'


#     Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
#     Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
#     Those three cats are Sara’s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
#     Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.
class Siamese(Cat):
    pass

all_cats = [ Bengal("bangal", 10) , Chartreux("chartreusx", 4) , Siamese("siamese", 23)]
sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
sara_pets.walk()


# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions

#     Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
#     Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
#         bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
#         run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
#         fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

#     Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name,age,weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking"
    def run_speed(self):
        return (self.weight / self.age) *10
    def fight(self , other_dog):
        if self.run_speed() * self.weight > other_dog.run_speed() * other_dog.weight:
            return f"{self.name} won the fight"
        else:
            return f"{other_dog.name} won the fight"
grace = Dog('grace', 5, 30)
wiskers = Dog('wiskers', 9, 10)
brazy = Dog('brazy',3, 15)
print(brazy.fight(wiskers))


# 🌟 Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions

#     Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
#     In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
#     Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
#     Add the following methods:
#         train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

#         play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.

#         do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
#             “dog_name does a barrel roll”.
#             “dog_name stands on his back legs”.
#             “dog_name shakes your hand”.
#             “dog_name plays dead”.
